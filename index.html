      <h1>About</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>BSD 4 ALL is a collective of Beaverton School District community members which envisions a public school district that is transparent in its actions, accountable to its constituents, and shares decision-making with all of its stake-holders.</p>

      <h1>Points of Unity</h1>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>By <b>ALL</b> we mean <i>especially</i> those who are made vulnerable on the margins of our community. We <i>therefore</i> center the needs and experiences of those who are most impacted by the injustices in our schools and fight for schools that do the same.</li>
        <li>We cannot speak for others. We <i>therefore</i> work in coalition with organizations and communities that organize for the common good. This includes labor unions, communities of color,  disabled people, undocumented people, LGBTQIA+ people, and <b>ALL</b> oppressed peoples.</li>
        <li>We fight for democratically run, community controlled schools where community members, families, students, and educators collaborate. We <i>therefore</i> fight for public schools that are governed by and accountable to <b>ALL</b> of us.</li>
        <li>Underfunding threatens the existence of public education as we know it. We <i>therefore</i> have a shared responsibility to demand resources, policies, and action, from every level of government, until we have the fully funded schools we <b>ALL</b> deserve.</li>
        <li>We will make mistakes. We <i>therefore</i> are committed to addressing those mistakes with transparency, accountability, and action.</li>

        <div class="event-description">In hopes of providing community members an opportunity to hear directly from candidates, BSD 4 ALL is holding a candidate forum and inviting all candidates running for Beaverton School District School Board to attend. The program will be moderated and consist of questions gathered ahead of time from the community at large and provided to all candidates in advance. Afterwards, we hope to open up the forum to a live Q & A session with those in attendance.</div>
